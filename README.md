# Backend-BoltAI
AI Stock &amp; Company Evaluator is a smart web application that allows users to analyze companies, stocks, or cryptocurrencies instantly by simply entering their names. It uses AI to provide financial insights, performance evaluation, and market summaries — all within seconds.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (frontend) and connected to a Node.js backend (API), this project demonstrates the power of AI in financial decision-making.

🚀 Features
🔍 Instant Analysis: Enter any stock or company name to get an AI-powered summary.
💬 Smart Insights: Understand trends, strengths, and growth indicators.
⚡ Fast Results: Real-time fetching and markdown-rendered output.
🎨 Modern UI: Clean, dark-themed interface with animated background (Particles.js).
📈 Expandable Backend: Designed to integrate with live market APIs or AI models later.

Backend:

💡 How It Works
The user enters a company or stock name (e.g., Bitcoin, Tesla, Infosys).
The app sends a POST request to the backend with the entered name.
The backend fetches/returns an AI-generated analysis in markdown format.
The result is displayed dynamically inside the “box” section after a loading animation.
